# Fake_news-detection-using-machine-learning-

This project demonstrates a machine learning pipeline for fake news detection. It involves:

Data preprocessing, including text cleaning and lemmatization.
Feature extraction using TF-IDF.
Model training and evaluation using a Random Forest classifier.
Time series analysis of article trends over time.
Visualizations showcasing fake and true news trends.
The project includes reusable code for preprocessing text, training models, and generating insights from news datasets.

Files:

fake_news_detector_model.pkl: Trained Random Forest model.
tfidf_vectorizer.pkl: TF-IDF vectorizer used for feature extraction.
combined_news_dataset.csv: Preprocessed and combined dataset of fake and true news.
